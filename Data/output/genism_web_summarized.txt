This four-door sportscar looks identical to the 3 Series sibling, but still has many essentials to set it apart from the ordinary., The front bumpers sport a low chin, massive air-intakes and are devoid of chrome highlights.
Still, I liked the light shade leather in this car, which looks and feels premium.
The carbon accents and M badges further add that exclusive touch to it., With great frontal visibility, you can sit nice and low in the driver's seat offering adequate support with adjustable bolsters.
BMW's high-resolution colour display screen is crisp and gets a DVD drive, integrated hard drive for maps and audio files.
As the two turbochargers operate to propel a lot of air to the cylinders, the high revs help in providing an instant throttle response with a unique engine note.
Still, the engine doesn't feel strained and there's a linear power delivery ensuring a smooth drive., BMW's TwinPower Turbo technology has played a vital role in maximising the torque which is available from a low 1,850rpm till up to 5,500rpm.
There are three modes, the first one being a little slower and smoother than the third one, which is very quick and pushes the car forward with a jerk.
This includes comfort, sport and sport+ to alter the power delivery, steering and suspension settings.
We were in comfort mode at most times and the M3 did reasonably well on our roads despite its firm suspension.
This is where the suspension also firms up even more, helping you to go around bends at high speeds.
Brakes have that bite and stop the car assertively and confidently even under hard braking., With most sportscars one has to choose performance over practicality.
But if the places you drive to have nicely paved roads, the M3 is the perfect car for you.
In fact, what we now have is still a performance-focused, lightweight and yet a trendy and practical four-door sportscar.
Note that the latter is expensive at Rs 1.36 crores, but is more powerful too!, Pictures by Kapil Angane, Want the CarTrade True Price for this car?
